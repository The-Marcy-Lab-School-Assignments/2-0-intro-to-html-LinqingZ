# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

2/3. You can further describe "non-semantic" by saying those elements are used for "grouping".
